## Introduction

This is a simple, standalone, pedagogical deep learning library written entirely in Python. 
It implements common neural network layers, loss functions, and first-order optimizers in a naive but transparent way,
and is meant as an ongoing exercise in thoroughly understanding deep neural networks, backpropogation, regularization techniques, etc.

Of course, it's way, way too slow to be of any practical use. 

The model_zoo.py script is a good place to start; it constructs some simple model architectures and also demonstrates the API for model training.
